##Description
This project seeks to use databases to create an online website that assists with the planning of potluck/group dinners, as well as other group-contribution projects. 

Main components:

- A user should be able to create a page for their particular potluck (with a unique URL that can be emailed to potential guests). Things like a title, short description, date, time, and location of the event should be listed here, as well as all ingredients/materials required for the event so that users can sign up to bring these ingredients/materials. 
-The creator of a potluck should be able to list ingredients/items that guests are requested to bring. Guests should be able to access the page using a hyperlink and be able to easily indicate that they are bringing certain items. It might be cool if users could update with purchases prices and mark items as complete (i.e. they went to the store and bought the item, etc.). It may also be appropriate for users to suggest additional items that the host did not list. 
- When a user creates a potluck and lists requested items, the database will be searched for similar potlucks (in terms of items requested) that have happened in the past. The website would suggest complimentary items not listed. For example, if a creator listed “green eggs” as a requested item, and 90% of other potlucks that listed “green eggs” also asked for “ham”, then the website would suggest that the creator also add “ham” to the list. This feature would become more useful as more and more people started using the tool. (Or we could jump-start this by adding data ourselves.)
