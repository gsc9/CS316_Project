  CrowdCon - Okay, this might be a hard sell, but imagine a picture of kraken (i.e. a giant mythological squid that terrorizes Jonny Depp (in the picture he is not actually terrifying jonny depp but you get the idea)) with a different application for the use of our planning tool symbolized in  objects in each of his tenticle hands. This would show how we can use the tool not just for potlucks, but anything your imagination might desire and user agreement (within the constraints of our database). Examples include potluck, pit orchestras, and costumes for a play.
