  Help Me Make my Dinner (H3MD)

  * CrowdCon - Okay, this might be a hard sell, but imagine a picture of a kraken (i.e. a giant mythological squid that 
  terrorizes Johnny Depp (in the picture he is not actually terrifying Johnny Depp but you get the idea)) with a different 
  application for the use of our planning tool symbolized in objects in each of his tenticle hands. This would show how we 
  can use the tool not just for potlucks, but anything your imagination might desire and user agreement (within the 
  constraints of our database). Examples include potluck, pit orchestras, and costumes for a play.
  
It seems like we are going with CrowdsourceContribution (CrowdCon), but this is open to change!
