Milestone 2 README


To acquire the production data set, run the Generate Data.jar file included with the project. Doing so will cause a file called GEN-PRODUCTION.SQL in the directory with the .jar file. This GEN-PRODUCTION.SQL file contains all the SQL statements required to create and populate the database tables. The production data set is randomly generated, but the same seed for the random number generator is used every time, so the "random" data generated is identical each time the .jar file is run.
